Welcome to GDSGE's documentation! 

GDSGE is a toolbox that solves nonlinear Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models with a global method based on policy iterations
introduced in paper xxxx.
It provides an interface that allows users to define economic models in a compact and intuitive script.
It parses the script into c++ files, which implement the actual computations with high performance.

The toolbox can be used to solve models in macroeconomics, international finance, asset pricing, etc.
